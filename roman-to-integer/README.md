# Intuition
-Each number convert to ROMAN number,
-For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.


# Complexity

- Time complexity:

        The code iterates through the input string 's' of length 'n' in a single loop, performing constant time operations for each character. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).
