# Intuition
- The array will send and this code find to the same one in first element of array.
- The algorithm check control element of each word.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

        O(n^2) The code contains nested loops. The outer loop runs through the 'strs' array of length 'n', and the inner loop runs through the characters of the strings in the array. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2) where 'n' is the total number of characters in all strings combined.
